# chrome-ad-enforcement-skip

This extension detects when you are being blocked by Youtube for using an adblocker, and replaces the default player with an embedded one, so it plays normally.

**Important notice:**
*Ads on Youtube are the only way to earn money for some smaller creators. While i think the decision to display multiple unskippable advertisements before videos is flawed, and it will lead to even more ways to skip or disable them, i don't condemn Youtube for trying to make you buy premium subscription, or watch ads. Every business has to stay profitable. That is true for both large corporations like Google and small creators who put their time and effort into making content for their communities.*

*Using this extension is in a very morally-gray area. Support creators you watch, especially the independant ones.*
